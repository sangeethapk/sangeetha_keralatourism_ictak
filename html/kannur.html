                    Kannur is a coastal city in the south Indian state of Kerala. It was once an ancient trading port.
                    Enduring monuments such as 16th-century St. Angelo Fort, once occupied by European colonial forces,
                    show the city’s significant role in the spice trade. Housed in a former palace, the Arakkal Museum
                    highlights Kerala's one Muslim royal family. The palm-fringed sands of Payyambalam Beach run along
                    Kannur’s western shore.

                                Kerala? Come to Kanjirakolli, on the foothills of Western Ghats bordering the Coorg
                                forest range of Karnataka. Against the undulating hills and valleys, Kanjirakolli seems
                                like the picture postcard of a village. The place is so enchanting that those early
                                visitors to the village might have kept the beauty of the place a secret for a very long
                                time. Inhabited by migrants from central Kerala, tribals of Kurichya and Karimpalar
                                communities, the village now is slowly waking up to its tourist potential. Take an
                                off-road from the Kanjirakolli that leads to the woods, disappear from all your known
                                worlds.
