                                largest fort. The 300-year-old fort actually looks like a giant keyhole and is among the
                                best preserved forts in the state courtesy the conservation efforts of Bekal Tourism
                                Development Corporation. A water tank with a flight of steps is the key feature of this
                                fort. A tunnel opening towards the south and a space for storing ammunition with steps
                                leading to the observation tower characterise this fort. As you climb up you will be
                                rewarded with one of the best views of the ocean and its surroundings. In fact, you can
                                also see the neighbouring towns of Kanhangad, Kottikkulam, Pallikkara and Uduma from
                                here. In the past, the observation tower was strategically important to keep an eye on
                                intruders and safeguard the fort against enemies. There are many holes in the outer wall
                                of the fort that were used to aim at and attack intruders. This inherent defence
                                mechanism of the fort can be seen from the zigzag entrance and the trenches surrounding
                                the place. Nearby, there is Mukhyaprana Temple dedicated to Lord Hanuman as well as an
                                ancient mosque, which reflects religious solidarity.
