                                    A small banana plantation has to be traversed to reach the 200-year-old museum next
                                    to the Padmanabha Swamy Temple. The Puthe Maliga Palace Museum was once the palace
                                    of the Maharaja of Travancore. It&rsquo;s main attraction lies in the carved wooden
                                    ceilings, marble sculptures and even imported Belgian glass that richly embellishes
                                    the inside of the palace. The palace is also called Kuthira Malika (palace of
                                    horses), after the 122 horse figures in the brackets of the walls; these can still
                                    be seen in the palace if you lean out of the balconies and see. There is a scheduled
                                    guide who takes a small group around the palace, giving anecdotes and pointing out
                                    the highlights. Do see the museum with a guide to get better context of the place.
                                    Though your admission ticket includes the cost of this guide, you may want to tip
                                    him/her over that this is recommended. The annual classical music festival held at
                                    the Puthe Maliga Palace Museum from January 6 to 12 is graced by prestigious
                                    musicians and is free for the public.

                                <p class="card-text">Sasthamcotta Lake or Sasthamkotta Lake, also categorized as a wetland, is the largest fresh water lake in Kerala, a state of India on the south of the West Coast. The lake is named after the ancient Sastha temple located on its bank. It meets the drinking water needs of half million people of the Quilon district and also provides fishing resources.
                                     The purity of the lake water for drinking use is attributed to the presence of large population of larva called cavaborus that consumes bacteria in the lake water. The lake is a designated wetland of international importance under the Ramsar Convention since November 2002. </p>
