                    Palakkad, or Palghat, is a city in Kerala, a state in southwestern India. The 18th-century Palakkad
                    Fort has sturdy battlements, a moat and a Hanuman temple on its grounds. North, on the Kalpathy
                    River, the 15th-century Viswanatha Swamy Temple is the main venue of the famous Ratholsavam chariot
                    festival. Northeast, near Malampuzha Dam, the town of Malampuzha has a rock garden created from
                    recycled materials.

                                Unlike the other forts of the country, the Palakkad Fort, also known by the name of
                                Tipus Fort was built to enhance communication between Palakkad and Coimbatore. The fort
                                was originally constructed by Hyder Ali, Tipus father. However it fell into the hands of
                                the British in 1784 and Zamorins in 1790.

                                Today, the fort is under the protection and care of the ASI (Archaeological Survey of .
                                The fort is not only worth visiting because of its historical importance, rather it has
                                a pleasant ambience that encourages you to take a walk in the evenings. Moreover, the
                                Children’s parks ensure that the place is full of cheerful and enthusiastic voices.
                                There is also an auditorium and a small museum in the fort.

                            <p class="card-text">Kalpathy Agraharam or the Brahmin Village is one of the most notable
                                features of Palakkad. It was recently given the status of being the ‘First Heritage
                                Village’ of Kerala.

                                The Vishwanathaswamy Temple is located on the southern banks of river Kalpathy and is
                                around 3 km from Palakkad. The temple, dedicated to Lord Shiva in 1425, is not a huge
                                structure, nevertheless it has a huge flagpole which is put to good use during the
                                annual Chariot festival.

                                The festival of Kalpathy Ratholsavam, a huge crowd puller, continues for seven days and
                                has people competing with each other to pull the elegantly beautified chariot supposed
                                to be made sacred by the presence of Lord Shiva. On usual days, the temple is open from
                                5 to 11.30 am and then from 5 to 7.30 pm.

                                Malampuzha has something to offer to every kind of visitor. There is a wonderful rose
                                garden with 100 species of roses for you to savour, a snake park with a large variety of
                                reptiles to send a chilly sensation down your body, a ropeway ride at a height of 60
                                feet to view the garden from above, a fancy park with as many as 20 ride options and a
                                KTDC Garden House offering pedal boats, motor boats, row-boats and water scooters for a
                                trip round the reservoir.

                                If none of the above interests you, then you can simply have a look at the sculpture of
                                the bare bodied Yakshi (demoness) with the head flung back and raised fisted hands
                                positioned close to the ears. Malampuzha is an ideal picnic spot in every sense and is
                                just 14 km from Palakkad.
