                                named Venmalanadu in the bygone era. The northwestern zone of Kottayam district holds
                                Vaikom. Visiting the Vaikom Shiva Temple is a must on your visit to Vaikom. History
                                marks the significant Vaikom Satyagraha Moment to this place. Vaikom is a peaceful and
                                well-administered place. Ernakulam and Kottayam as very near to the Vaikom.The oxygen

                                top, one can get a fine view of the Thrissur city and Thrissur Kole Wetlands, making the
                                place one of the most favourite picnic spots in the region.

                                Simply surreal, the experience from the 5-acre hilltop is only enhanced by the
                                construction of an amusement park, where there are a number of rides that the kids can
