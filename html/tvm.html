                        Thiruvananthapuram (or Trivandrum) is the capital of the southern Indian state of Kerala. It's
                        distinguished by its British colonial architecture and many art galleries.
                        It’s also home to Kuthira Malika (or Puthen Malika) Palace, adorned with carved horses and
                        displaying collections related to the Travancore royal family, whose regional capital was here
                        from the 18th–20th centuries.

                                    A small banana plantation has to be traversed to reach the 200-year-old museum next
                                    to the Padmanabha Swamy Temple. The Puthe Maliga Palace Museum was once the palace
                                    of the Maharaja of Travancore. It&rsquo;s main attraction lies in the carved wooden
                                    ceilings, marble sculptures and even imported Belgian glass that richly embellishes
                                    the inside of the palace. The palace is also called Kuthira Malika (palace of
                                    horses), after the 122 horse figures in the brackets of the walls; these can still
                                    be seen in the palace if you lean out of the balconies and see. There is a scheduled
                                    guide who takes a small group around the palace, giving anecdotes and pointing out
                                    the highlights. Do see the museum with a guide to get better context of the place.
                                    Though your admission ticket includes the cost of this guide, you may want to tip
                                    him/her over that this is recommended. The annual classical music festival held at
                                    the Puthe Maliga Palace Museum from January 6 to 12 is graced by prestigious
                                    musicians and is free for the public.

                                <p class="card-text">The Shanghumugham Beach lies about 8 km away, on the Western part
                                    of Thiruvananthapuram city. The huge sculpture of a 'Nymph' (Jalakanyaka) made by
                                    the famous sculptor Sri Kanai Kunjuraman is a great attraction. A star-shaped
                                    restaurant is also seen here. The Thiruvananthapuram International Airport and a
                                    flying club are located near by. Fishing is an attractive scene in Shanghumugham
                                    Beach.Shanghumugham beach wears a festive look during the temple festivals. The
                                    beach is more crowded during the weekends and local holidays. Sunset at this beach
                                    is sight worth seeing. The Chacha Nehru Traffic Training Park here attracts children
                                    and helps them to learn the traffic rules. The number of people visiting the beach
                                    has increased in recent times.
                                    There are many vendors who put up street side stalls around the beach.</p>

                                <p class="card-text">Historians say the temple dates back to the 8th century but the
                                    present structure was built in the 18th century by the then Travancore Maharaja
                                    Marthanda Varma.

                                    The temple is built in the unique Chera style of architecture, and its main deity is
                                    Lord Vishnu who is found in the Anantha Shayana posture (reclined posture of eternal
                                    yoga) on Adishesha or king of all serpents.

                                    It is known to be one of the 108 holy temples associated with Vaishnavism in India.

                                    Since independence, the temple had been controlled by a trust run by the royal
                                    family right until 1991, when the last ruler of Travancore, Chithira Thirunal
                                    Balarama Varma, passed away.

                                    Even after the death of the last Travancore ruler in 1991, the state government
                                    allowed the management of the temple to be taken over and retained by his younger
                                    brother, Uthradam Thirunal Marthanda Varma.

                                    But in 2011, the Kerala High Court ruled that the family cannot continue to exert
                                    its shebait rights. Shebait is a person who serves a Hindu deity and manages the
                                    temple.

                                    That ruling has now been overturned. ThePrint explains the temple, its rulers and
                                    the treasures that made the Padmanabhaswamy Temple grab headlines.</p>
